## Advent of code 2024
These are my solutions to the first 10 days of [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) using Python,

Each folder contains:
- a single `.py` file for solutions to both part 1 and 2
- `input.txt` as given by AoC

Some folders contain a `myinput.txt` which has a shorter input for ease of testing and debugging


### Skills demonstrated
 file I/O, libraries (`re`, `numpy`, `copy`), list comprehensions, custom filtering (`lambda`, `filter()`), custom functions, string parsing and manipulation, use of sets and dictionaries
